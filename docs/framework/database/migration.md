## Introduction

Migrations are a key part of the LAMC Framework, allowing for systematic database schema management. This guide covers the creation and management of migrations to ensure smooth schema evolution over time.

## Creating a migrations

Migrations in the LAMC Framework are created by defining classes that implement the `Migration` interface. Each migration class should contain methods for both applying (`up`) and reverting (`down`) the migration.

## Migration functions

- `up()`: Apply the changes defined in the migration.
- `down()`: Revert the changes made by the migration.

## Example

An example migration to create a 'users' table:

```java
public class CreateUserTable implements Migration {
    @Override
    public void up() {
        // Logic to create the users table
    }

    @Override
    public void down() {
        // Logic to drop the users table
    }
}
```
